## Model Comparison and Inference

- **Best Model by Accuracy**: GRU
- **Fastest Training Time**: MLP
- **Inference**:
  - GRU achieved the highest accuracy of 0.88.
  - CNN-BiLSTM has a competitive performance but took longer to train.
  - MLP, though faster, had the lowest accuracy.
  - GNN is effective but requires longer training.

### Recommendations:
- Use GRU for high accuracy with reasonable training time.
- CNN-BiLSTM can be used if temporal relationships are critical.
- Optimize GNN further to reduce training time.
